ECs is used to manage and run container in aws. It is a cluster of EC2 instances and within ec2 instances there are serveral containers running. 
It is highly scalable.
It is of two types

1 - Farget hosted model
2 - Ec2 hosted model

ec2 hosted model - in this you will be able to see ec2 instances and within that there will be containers. In this model you will have to manage clusters and edverything.

farget model - in this model aws will manage everythig and you won't see ec2 instances in dashboard. you just have to cpecify the size and type,

Ec2 hosted are cheaper. But if your tasks are not running for very long and there is fluctations in resources then use frgate model.
