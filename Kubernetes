and in production we can  use AWS-EKs or GKE of GCP and we can create kubernetes cluter by ourself but it is bit difficult so for starting we can use these managed
cloud services
Minikuber - it is used to mange VM(node) we use this only in local environment
kubectl - use to manage and interact  conatiners in node. both in local and prod


pod - we are always going to deploy conatiner on it and we have to use pod to deploy containers. These are used if we ant to run one or more very closely related
containers
