These are used when you have to create different typ and number of conatiners on different machines

In deverlopment we use it with progarame called "Minikube" and it is used to setup kubernetes on local machine
and in production we can  use AWS-EKs or GKE of GCP and we can create kubernetes cluter by ourself but it is bit difficult so for starting we can use these managed
cloud services
Minikuber - it is used to mange VM(node) we use this only in local environment
kubectl - use to manage and interact  conatiners in node. both in local and prod
