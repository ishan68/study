These are used when you have to create different typ and number of conatiners on different machines
cluster - Assembly of master and one or mode nodes
nodes - A node is a virtual machine or physical comp which is running container and each of them run different different conatiner with different images
master - through which we interact with cluster

In deverlopment we use it with progarame called "Minikube" and it is used to setup kubernetes on local machine
and in production we can  use AWS-EKs or GKE of GCP and we can create kubernetes cluter by ourself but it is bit difficult so for starting we can use these managed
cloud services
Minikuber - it is used to mange VM(node) we use this only in local environment
kubectl - use to manage and interact  conatiners in node. both in local and prod


pod - we are always going to deploy conatiner on it and we have to use pod to deploy containers. These are used if we want to run one or more very closely related
containers

service - sets up networking insiode kubernetes cluster and it has following types
  1 - cluster ip
  2 - NodePort - expose the port to outside world and it is yused only in dev env.
      Port- this is use for coonecting with other container or pod
      Target Port-- inside the conatiner port
  3 - LoadBalancer
  3 - ingress
  
  Kube proxy - Its a one single window to communicate to outside world.any request coming to node will flow through kube proxy anfd this will inspect the request and route it to
  specific pod

selector - it is use to identify on which service need to send traffic






Kubectl get nodes
kubectl get pod

To create components we use create cmd
e.g create nginx deployment

kubectl create deployment ngin-depl --image=nginx
now if i do - kubectl get deployment
there is one more command to manage replicas of pod, which is
kubectl get replicaset 

----Each config file has 3 parts---
1 - metadata
2 - specifications
3 - status

There are two types of deployments
1- declarative 
2- imperative - 

Its easier to use declarative deployments as we ask master to manage all thing where in imperative you need to define everything
To get detailed description of object inside our cluster we use,'
kubectl describe pods client-pod

We can update config files for pod like it image and if we feed it to kubectl it will modify the current container it won't create new one
but if we try to update port number, it will prompt a error message
So to overcome this we use something called deployments
Kind-Deployments - it maintains a idetical set of pods and always in runnable state
The difference between pod and deployments is the pod runs a single set of container where as deployment can run multiple identical pods
Deployment is good both dev and prod whereas pod is mostly used in dev env
In deployments we can change any part of config file whereas in pod we can just change image name


status will compare the current state with desired state.
to get information of services
kubectl describe service nginx-service
to get ip address of pods
- kubectl get pod -o wide
delete services - kubectl delete -f nginx-servic.yml
delete deployments - kubectl delete -f nginx-development.yml

From now onwards we are gonna use deployments instead of pods as 
example of deployment config file 


apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata: 
  name: client-deployment
spec:
  replicas: 1
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      component: web
  template:
    metadata:
      label:
        component: web
    spec:
      containers:
        - name: client
          image: ishan68/nodejs-demo
          ports:
            - containerPort: 3000
            
  In this there is a spec block which has a selctor in it. This matchlabele is added to evry pods thats get created by deployment
  There's a another label specified in the config which could be different. We can specify multiple labels in config file
