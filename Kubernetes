These are used when you have to create different typ and number of conatiners on different machines

In deverlopment we use it with progarame called "Minikube" and it is used to setup kubernetes on local machine
and in production we can  use AWS-EKs or GKE of GCP and we can create kubernetes cluter by ourself but it is bit difficult so for starting we can use these managed
cloud services
Minikuber - it is used to mange VM(node) we use this only in local environment
kubectl - use to manage and interact  conatiners in node. both in local and prod


pod - we are always going to deploy conatiner on it and we have to use pod to deploy containers. These are used if we want to run one or more very closely related
containers

service - sets up networking insiode kubernetes cluster and it has following types
  1 - cluster ip
  2 - NodePort - expose the port to outside world and it is yused only in dev env.
      Port- this is use for coonecting with other container or pod
      Target Port-- inside the conatiner port
  3 - LoadBalancer
  3 - ingress
  
  Kube proxy - Its a one single window to communicate to outside world.any request coming to node will flow through kube proxy anfd this will inspect the request and route it to
  specific pod

selector - it is use to identify on which service need to send traffic






Kubectl get nodes
kubectl get pod

To create components we use create cmd
e.g create nginx deployment

kubectl create deployment ngin-depl --image=nginx
now if i do - kubectl get deployment
there is one more command to manage replicas of pod, which is
kubectl get replicaset
