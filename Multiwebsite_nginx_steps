Step1:-

dotnet installtion is same as provided by you, only change is that we need to set diffrent port numbers for both websites


So copied dotnet project files in two diffrent folders

folder1 - site1
folder2 -site2

step2:-

cd site1

Now we need to change port number by adding code 

vim appsettings.json
"Kestrel": {
             "EndPoints": {
               "Http": {
                "Url": "http://localhost:4300"
                                            }
                                         }
                                        },


Step 3:-

 cd ../site2

change port number here as well by adding code

vim appsettings.json
"Kestrel": {
             "EndPoints": {
               "Http": {
                "Url": "http://localhost:4200"
                                            }
                                         }
                                        },




Step4:-

We can check weather ports are conflicting or not by running server for both website on both directory site1 and site2

dotnet EcoTechAPIs.dll

Now install nginx as you did on EC2 instance


Creating virtual host--------

Step5:-

vim /etc/nginx/sites-available/site1.example.com

 code inside--

server
{
    listen 80;
    listen [::]:80;
    server_name site1.example.com www.site1.example.com;

    location /
    {
        proxy_pass http://127.0.0.1:4300;
        proxy_http_version 1.1;
       proxy_set_header Upgrade $http_upgrade;
       proxy_set_header Connection keep-alive;
       proxy_set_header Host $host;
       proxy_cache_bypass $http_upgrade;
    }
}

Step6:-
same for website2
vim /etc/nginx/sites-available/site2.example.com

server
{
    listen 80;
    listen [::]:80;
    server_name site2.example.com www.site2.example.com;

    location /
    {
        proxy_pass http://127.0.0.1:4200;
        proxy_http_version 1.1;
       proxy_set_header Upgrade $http_upgrade;
       proxy_set_header Connection keep-alive;
       proxy_set_header Host $host;
       proxy_cache_bypass $http_upgrade;
    }
}


Step7:-
creation of soft links to enable these configuration------

ln -s /etc/nginx/sites-available/site1.example.com.conf /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/

ln -s /etc/nginx/sites-available/site2.example.com.conf /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/


step8:-

nginx -t 

systemctl restart nginx 

Start server on site1
 
Step9:-

dotnet EcoTechAPIs.dll

start server on site 2

dotnet EcoTechAPIs.dll
